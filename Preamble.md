**The purpose of this repository is to share the steps involved that will be used to create a free (to use) web host and web application creation platform service for the Internet community.** <br>

Some of you may ask, "why does the Internet community need this"? Hosting is something that I feel is a very personal decision. Here are my reasons for wanting to create such a service:

One) Unobstrusive, free hosting never goes out of style<br>
Two) It provides people a free platform to try new code<br>
Three) Creates a community that could support each other<br>
Four) It's exciting to get something with no sign-ups, cost or personal information<br>
Five) Providing a free service fosters creativity among those involved<br>
Six) Free stuff is cool :)<br>
Seven) To help people. In particular those with outrageous electric bills from Pentium 4 servers running all day <br>
<br>
Although there are too many reasons to list, I think the above covers the meat and potatoes with respects to the necessity for this service. Those of you that were around in the 1990s will remember sites like [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) which were an enormous benefit to myself and the millions of others that wanted to develop web sites for a living. Hopefully we can spawn a new generation while improving at the same time.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, comments, concerns, etc. please do not hesitate to contact me. As this project progresses, I will update this repository to reflect the progress. Sit tight and get ready to code!<br>
